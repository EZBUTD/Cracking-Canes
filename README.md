# Cracking Canes
Documentation of the path to victory

Dallas, TX. February 2017. We were 4 seniors at UT Dallas with too much time on our hands. Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers was a favorite establishment of ours, and their annual Peel the Love promotion was ongoing. The promotion was simple:

1. Gain 2 tickets from purchasing a drink at the resturaunt, one of was a puzzle piece for a big reward. The other was a code for an online lottery(for food and merch) or an instant prize.
2. Once a day, gain a code for the online lottery by playing a game on an app.

Sensing an opportunity to win, we decided to all download the app and start playing daily, and enlisted several close friends to help us. Rather than use the codes right away, we stockpiled them in a shared document while we decided to do some analysis on the lottery.

After some research, we discovered that results for the lottery were published online, an seemed to update live. The most experienced [programmer](https://github.com/atvaccaro/) among us built a tool with scrapy and captured the changes to this list over a few days, which became our main data source for analysis.
